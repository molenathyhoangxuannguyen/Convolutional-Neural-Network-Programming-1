    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be implementing two stages of a convolutional neural network (CNN), (1) convolving, and (2) pooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "The learning goals for this assignment are: \n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> familiarizing yourself with what a convolution is and how it works </li>\n",
    "    <li> familiarizing yourself with what max pooling is and how it works </li>\n",
    "    <li> remind yourself of how file processing works </li>\n",

    "### Important point: All the cells in this Notebook need to run from top to bottom in that order and your Notebook may become cluttered with output.

    "    <li> <b><code>convolve()</code></b> - this process takes an input (often an image), and a filter, and it \n",
    "        outputs a transformation of that input after the filter has been applied to it. It may not have been \n",
    "        clear from the video, but the output of this operation is slightly smaller than the input. <br>\n",
    "        <i>try to think of why that is the case</i>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li> <b><code>pooling()</code></b> - this process takes an input (again, often an image) and a filter size \n",
    "        or stride length, and generates a smaller version after applying a \"pooling\" process. Given an image of \n",
    "        <code>n</code> rows and columns and a stride length of <code>s</code>, can you figure out what the output\n",
    "        image size is?\n",

    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the videos, she presented how the transformation looks like visually in the Excel spreadsheet, and these operations are done within a CNN by the way that the network is structured. *This is unlike in an ANN we have covered so far, where we do not impose any structure in advance.* However, for this assignment, you will implement both operations procedurally (using loops) in Python to get a good sense of how they work. We will embed these operations within an CNN class, to keep it consistent with previous assignments. I am providing you a constructor for this class, which primarily serves to set its filter, and a setter function in which you can set a different filter to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start with implementing convolution, and then to pooling. You can comment out the functions in the *main()* function to check one or the other as you see fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The *convolve()* function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes as input an image (a list of list data structure). The filter is set when the CNN object is first created. You can assume that the dimensions of the image are multiples of 3 to simplify your implementation. This function iterates from the first row, first coloumn on the image and iterates down the image. At each location, say, \\[rowIndex,colIndex\\], the function performs a dot-product of the input image at that location and the filter, producing a single number. This number is saved in the output image at position \\[rowIndex,colIndex\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "### The *max_pool()* function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes as input an image (again, a list of lists data structure) and a stride, say called, *stride*. It starts from the top left of the list of lists, say, \\[rowIndex,colIndex\\] and takes the maximum value in the *stride*x*stride* square based off of \\[rowIndex,colIndex\\]. That max value is then stored in the output \"image\", which is a list of lists.\n",
